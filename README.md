# TravelTide Customer Segmentation Project

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **TravelTide Project**, where customer segmentation techniques were applied to deliver data-driven recommendations aligned with business objectives. The project was focused on improving customer retention for **TravelTide**, an e-booking startup, by analyzing customer behavior and suggesting personalized perks to enhance their rewards program.

## Project Overview

The project was structured into four key stages over the course of four weeks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Conducted an in-depth analysis of the available data, cleaning and preparing tables at both session and customer levels. This phase involved understanding the business context, identifying outliers, and ensuring the dataset was ready for segmentation analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Created meaningful metrics and attributes that helped distinguish between different customer behaviors. This step was crucial in defining the factors that could lead to effective segmentation.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Applied clustering techniques and customer analysis to identify distinct customer groups based on their shopping behavior. Each group was assigned tailored perks to align with their preferences, making the rewards program more personalized.

4. **Presentation of Results**  
   Delivered a comprehensive report and video presentation summarizing the key findings. The presentation focused on explaining the characteristics of the customer groups and providing actionable recommendations for TravelTide's future marketing strategies.

## Key Objectives
